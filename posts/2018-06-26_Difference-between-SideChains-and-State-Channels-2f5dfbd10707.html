But <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">in step 2 an unlimited number of updates can be rapidly made without the need to involve the blockchain at all</strong> — and this is where the power of state channels comes into play, because only steps 1 and 3 need to be published to the network, pay fees, or wait for <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Confirmation" data-href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Confirmation" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">confirmations</a>. In fact, with careful planning and design, state channels can remain open almost indefinitely, and be used as part of larger <a href="https://www.mail-archive.com/bitcoin-development@lists.sourceforge.net/msg06576.html" data-href="https://www.mail-archive.com/bitcoin-development@lists.sourceforge.net/msg06576.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">hub and spoke systems</a> to power an entire economy or ecosystem.</p><p name="08f4" id="08f4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Despite my simple description here, state/payment channels have generally been perceived as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdbsfRYskMk" data-href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdbsfRYskMk" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">quite complicated</a>. There are several reasons for this, and one of them is that <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">there are some important subtleties hidden in my phrasing</strong> of the three steps. Let’s take a closer look at what these simple phrases imply, starting with:</p><blockquote name="dca7" id="dca7" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">could be submitted to the blockchain</blockquote><p name="70a9" id="70a9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">In order for state channels to work, participants have to be assured that they <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">could</em> publish the current state of the channel to the blockchain at any time. This results in some important limitations, such as the fact that <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">someone has to stay online</strong> to protect each individual party’s interests until the channel is closed.</p><p name="2414" id="2414" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Imagine that when we initiated a payment channel I started with 100 bitcoins and you started with 10. If we first sign an update that transfers 10 of those bitcoins to me, and then <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">later</em> sign an update that transfers 50 back to you, the later update is obviously more beneficial to you than the earlier one is. If you were to <a href="http://www.slashgear.com/three-arrested-for-trying-to-cut-undersea-internet-cable-27275579/" data-href="http://www.slashgear.com/three-arrested-for-trying-to-cut-undersea-internet-cable-27275579/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">unexpectedly lose internet access</a>, and I were to pretend the second update never happened, I might be able to publish the first update to the blockchain and effectively <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">steal 50 bitcoins from you</em>! What you need is somebody to stay online with a copy of that later transaction so that they can “trump” the earlier one and make sure your bitcoins are protected. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">It doesn’t have to be you</strong> — you could send a copy to many random servers who agree via smart contract to publish it only if needed (for a small fee of course). But however you do it, you need to be assured that the latest signed update to the state is available to trump all others. Which leads us to our next subtle phrase:</p><blockquote name="3767" id="3767" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Each new update “trumps” previous updates</blockquote><p name="1f6b" id="1f6b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">To make this part of the state channel work, <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">the locking and unlocking mechanisms have to be properly designed</strong> so that old state updates submitted to the blockchain have a chance to be corrected by the newer state updates which replaced them. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The simplest way is to have any unlocking attempt start a timer</strong>, during which any <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">newer </em>update can replace the old update (restarting the timer as well). When the timer completes, the channel is closed and the state adjusted to reflect the last update received. The length of the timer would be chosen for each state channel, balancing the inconvenience of a long channel closing time with the increased safety it would provide against internet connection or <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/alert/2015-07-04-spv-mining#list-of-forks" data-href="https://bitcoin.org/en/alert/2015-07-04-spv-mining#list-of-forks" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">blockchain problems</a>. Alternatively, you could structure the channel with a financial penalty so that anyone publishing an inaccurate update to the blockchain will lose more than they could gain by pretending later transactions didn’t happen.</p><p name="121d" id="121d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But the mechanism ends up not mattering very much, because (going back to the previous point) the game theory of this situation puts a twist on things. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">As long as this mechanism is theoretically sound, it will probably never have to be used</strong>. Actually going through the timer/penalty process may introduce extra fees, delays, or other inconveniences; given that <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">forcing</em> someone into the mechanism can’t give you any advantage anyways, <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">parties to a state channel will probably just close the channel out by mutually agreeing</strong> on a final channel state. This final close-out operation needs to be fundamentally different from the normal “intermediate” updates (since it will bypass the “trumping” mechanism above), so <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">participants will only sign a final close-out transaction once for each portion of the state locked within a particular channel</strong>.</p><p name="0c32" id="0c32" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The details of these “subtleties” aren’t especially important. What it all ultimately breaks down to is that <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">participants open the channel by setting up a “judge”</strong> smart contract, <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">sign promises to each other</strong> which the judge can enforce and adjudicate if necessary, and then <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">close the channel by agreeing</strong> amongst themselves so that the judge’s adjudication isn’t needed. As long as the “judge” mechanism can be assumed to be reliable, these promises can be counted as instant transfers, with the judge only appealed to in exceptional circumstances, such as when one party disappears.</p><p name="b141" id="b141" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Of course, these details are only <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">part</em> of the reason people think that state/payment channels are complicated. A much bigger one is that <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Bitcoin payment channels <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">are </em>complicated</strong>. Building a “judge” mechanism in Bitcoin with even <a href="http://www.tik.ee.ethz.ch/file/716b955c130e6c703fac336ea17b1670/duplex-micropayment-channels.pdf" data-href="http://www.tik.ee.ethz.ch/file/716b955c130e6c703fac336ea17b1670/duplex-micropayment-channels.pdf" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reasonably useful properties</a> is surprisingly intricate. But once you have a clear concept of state channels in general, you can see that <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">this only comes from trying to implement the idea in a constrained context</strong>. Basic smart contract features like a timer mechanism and allowing two different paths to be taken depending on the signed message submitted are just plain harder to do in Bitcoin. Some of these features are being gradually added or built. By seeing that <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">payment channels are only a special subcase of the broader “state channel” idea</strong>, we realise that this is a much broader technique, and that <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">state channels can apply to any smart contract</strong> which deals with frequent updates between a defined set of participants. You can anticipate seeing this approach in many (if not most) distributed applications going forward.</p><p name="86a8" id="86a8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now we have a bit clear idea that what is a “state channel”. So, let’s move to side chain.</p><h3 name="84f6" id="84f6" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">What are SideChains ?</h3><blockquote name="cc2c" id="cc2c" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--h3"><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">A sidechain is a separate blockchain that is attached to its parent blockchain(mainchain) using a two-way peg.</strong></blockquote><p name="0c49" id="0c49" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">In other words, you can move assets to the sidechain and then back to the parent chain.</p><figure name="8039" id="8039" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 312px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 44.6%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*hFdtS94EIFeSQGWREnNWJw.png" data-width="720" data-height="321" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*hFdtS94EIFeSQGWREnNWJw.png"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">sidechain</figcaption></figure><p name="b950" id="b950" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The two-way peg enables interchangeability of assets at a predetermined rate between the parent blockchain and the sidechain. The original blockchain is usually referred to as the ‘main chain’ and all additional blockchains are referred to as ‘sidechains’. The blockchain platform Ardor refers to its sidechains as ‘childchains’.</p><p name="0386" id="0386" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A user on the parent chain first has to send their coins to an output address, where the coins become locked so the user is unable to spend them elsewhere. Once the transaction has been completed, a confirmation is communicated across the chains followed by a waiting period for extra security. After the waiting period, the equivalent number of coins is released on the sidechain, allowing the user to access and spend them there. The reverse happens when moving back from a sidechain to the main chain.</p><h4 name="18ed" id="18ed" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Federations</h4><p name="c500" id="c500" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">A federation is a group that serves as an intermediate point between a main chain and one of its sidechains. This group determines when the coins a user has used are locked up and released. The creators of the sidechain can choose the members of the federation. A problem with the federation structure is that it adds another layer between the main chain and the sidechain.</p><p name="cd1b" id="cd1b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Sidechains are responsible for their own security. If there isn’t enough mining power to secure a sidechain, it could be hacked. Since each sidechain is independent, if it is hacked or compromised, the damage will be contained within that chain and won’t affect the main chain. Conversely, should the main chain become compromised, the sidechain can still operate, but the peg will lose most of its value.</p><p name="92d4" id="92d4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Sidechains need their own miners. These miners can be incentivized through ‘merged mining’, whereby two separate cryptocurrencies, based on the same algorithm, are mined simultaneously.</p><p name="c343" id="c343" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Here is a list of some of the Sidechain Projects.</p><div name="f50c" id="f50c" class="graf graf--mixtapeEmbed graf-after--p"><a href="https://hackernoon.com/13-sidechain-projects-every-blockchain-developer-should-know-about-804b65364107" data-href="https://hackernoon.com/13-sidechain-projects-every-blockchain-developer-should-know-about-804b65364107" class="markup--anchor markup--mixtapeEmbed-anchor" title="https://hackernoon.com/13-sidechain-projects-every-blockchain-developer-should-know-about-804b65364107"><strong class="markup--strong markup--mixtapeEmbed-strong">11 sidechain projects every blockchain developer should know about</strong><br><em class="markup--em markup--mixtapeEmbed-em">The whole world is going through the blockchain revolution.

But once it is deployed, the cost per state update inside that channel is extremely low.</li></ul><h4 name="ac4e" id="ac4e" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--li">Sidechain pros</h4><ul class="postList"><li name="9d47" id="9d47" class="graf graf--li graf-after--h4"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--li-em">Sidechains are permanent. You don’t have create your own sidechain for specific purpose if there is one present: </em></strong>Sidechains are created and maintained once made. We don’t close sidechains, rather we lock the assets on sidechain to move back to the mainchain. This can be helpful in the way that anyone who is doing a specific task off blockchain/mainchain (for eg. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/61vg5k/dogethereum_we_can_do_this_dogether/" data-href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/61vg5k/dogethereum_we_can_do_this_dogether/" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">transacting in dogecoin</a>) will come to the same sidechain. So, you don’t have to create separate chains for every new participant. Whereas in state channels you usually have to create a new channel to add a new participant. But projects such as Lightning , Raiden network have come up with brilliant solution for this. They create a mesh of participants so you don’t have to create a new channel for every new participant you interact with. You can interact with participants indirectly creating a channel between you and recipient through some other participant who is common to both: you and the recipient.</li><li name="8fd2" id="8fd2" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--li-em">Sidechains allow cryptocurrencies to interact with one another:</em></strong> They add flexibility and allow developers to experiment with Beta releases of Altcoins or software updates before pushing them on to the main chain. Traditional banking functions like issuing and tracking ownership of shares can be tested on sidechains before moving them onto main chains.</li></ul><h4 name="d84a" id="d84a" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--li">Sidechain cons</h4><ul class="postList"><li name="03ea" id="03ea" class="graf graf--li graf-after--h4"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--li-em">Sidechains need a lot of initial investment to start off: </em></strong>To create a sidechain we need to have enough miners so that the network is safe from attackers. Also, we have to make it sure that they are up and running. Whereas there is no blockchain involved in state channels.

This could prove as another weak point for the attackers to attack by bribing or attacking the federation.
