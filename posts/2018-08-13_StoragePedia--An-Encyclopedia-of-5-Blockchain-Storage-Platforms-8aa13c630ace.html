The primary objective of Swarm is to provide a sufficiently decentralized and redundant store of Ethereum’s public record, in particular to store and distribute dapp code and data as well as blockchain data. From an economic point of view, it allows participants to efficiently pool their storage and bandwidth resources in order to provide these services to all participants of the network, all while being incentivised by Ethereum.</p><h3 name="7fde" id="7fde" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Objective</h3><p name="9dcc" id="9dcc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Swarm’s broader objective is to provide infrastructure services for developers of decentralised web applications (dapps), notably: <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">messaging, data streaming, peer to peer accounting, mutable resource updates, storage insurance, proof of custody scan and repair, payment channels and database services.</em></strong></p><p name="866c" id="866c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">From the end user’s perspective, Swarm is not that different from the world wide web, with the exception that uploads are not hosted on a specific server. Swarm offers a peer-to-peer storage and serving solution that is DDoS-resistant, has zero-downtime, fault-tolerant and censorship-resistant as well as self-sustaining due to a built-in incentive system which uses peer-to-peer accounting and allows trading resources for payment. Swarm is designed to deeply integrate with the devp2p multiprotocol network layer of Ethereum as well as with the Ethereum blockchain for domain name resolution (using ENS), service payments and content availability insurance.</p><p name="cca7" id="cca7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Note: </em></strong>In order to resolve ENS names, your Swarm node has to be connected to an Ethereum blockchain (mainnet, or testnet).</p><p name="d485" id="d485" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Please refer to our <a href="https://github.com/ethersphere/swarm/wiki/roadmap" data-href="https://github.com/ethersphere/swarm/wiki/roadmap" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">development roadmap</a> to stay informed with swarm’s progress.</p><h3 name="3318" id="3318" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Overview</h3><p name="6d0c" id="6d0c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Swarm is set out to provide base layer infrastructure for a new decentralised internet. Swarm is a peer-to-peer network of nodes providing distributed digital services by contributing resources (storage, message forwarding, payment processing) to each other. The Ethereum Foundation operates a Swarm testnet that can be used to test out functionality in a similar manner to the Ethereum testnet (ropsten). Everyone can join the network by running the Swarm client node on their server, desktop, laptop or mobile device. See <a href="https://swarm-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gettingstarted.html#getting-started" data-href="https://swarm-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gettingstarted.html#getting-started" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Getting started with Swarm</a> for how to do this. The Swarm client is part of the Ethereum stack, the reference implementation is written in golang and found under the go-ethereum repository. Currently at POC (proof of concept) version 0.3 is running on all nodes.</p><p name="8114" id="8114" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Swarm offers a <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">local HTTP proxy</strong> API that dapps or command line tools can use to interact with Swarm. Some modules like <a href="https://swarm-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/PSS" data-href="https://swarm-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/PSS" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">messaging</a> are only available through RPC-JSON API. The foundation servers on the testnet are offering public gateways, which serve to easily demonstrate functionality and allow free access so that people can try Swarm without even running their own node.</p><p name="b529" id="b529" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Swarm is a collection of nodes of the devp2p network each of which run the bzz protocol suite on the same network id.</p><p name="61e3" id="61e3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Swarm nodes can also connect with one (or several) ethereum blockchains for domain name resolution and one ethereum blockchain for bandwidth and storage compensation. Nodes running the same network id are supposed to connect to the same blockchain for payments. A Swarm network is identified by its network id which is an arbitrary integer.</p><p name="23cb" id="23cb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Swarm allows for <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">upload and disappear</em> which means that any node can just upload content to the Swarm and then is allowed to go offline. As long as nodes do not drop out or become unavailable, the content will still be accessible due to the ‘synchronization’ procedure in which nodes continuously pass along available data between each other.</p><h4 name="ecbf" id="ecbf" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Public gateways</h4><p name="2674" id="2674" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Swarm offers a local HTTP proxy API that Dapps can use to interact with Swarm.

It operates analogously to the DNS system, translating human-readable names into machine identifiers — in this case, the Swarm hash of the content you’re referring to. By registering a name and setting it to resolve to the content hash of the root manifest of your site, users can access your site via a URL such as <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">bzz://theswarm.eth/</code>.</p><p name="9aac" id="9aac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Note: </em></strong>Currently The bzz scheme is not supported in major browsers such as Chrome, Firefox or Safari.

When you upload content to Swarm, the uploaded data is split into 4 KB chunks. These chunks will all be encoded with a separate randomly generated encryption key. The encryption happens on your local Swarm node, unencrypted data is not shared with other nodes. The reference of a single chunk (and the whole content) will be the concatenation of the hash of encoded data and the decryption key. This means the reference will be longer than the standard unencrypted Swarm reference (64 bytes instead of 32 bytes).</p><p name="5c8a" id="5c8a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When your node syncs the encrypted chunks of your content with other nodes, it does not share the the full references (or the decryption keys in any way) with the other nodes. This means that other nodes will not be able to access your original data, moreover they will not be able to detect whether the synchronized chunks are encrypted or not.</p><p name="b1c0" id="b1c0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When your data is retrieved it will only get decrypted on your local Swarm node. During the whole retrieval process the chunks traverse the network in their encrypted form, and none of the participating peers are able to decrypt them.

Developers adopted these protocols over time and built their applications on top of this infrastructure. One of the protocols that serves as the backbone of the web is HTTP or HyperText Transfer Protocol. This was invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991.</p><figure name="4825" id="4825" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*lKagmhG-vuPd488ch3fN2g.png" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*lKagmhG-vuPd488ch3fN2g.png"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">Internet Protocol stack aka.

A client, for example a web browser, sends a request to an external server. The server then returns a response message, for example, the Google homepage back to the client. This is a location-addressed protocol which means when I type google.com into my browser, it gets translated into an IP address of some Google server, then the request-response cycle is initiated with that server.</p><figure name="a3c1" id="a3c1" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*-O38CCD1yx_2LGFIRTWiag.png" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*-O38CCD1yx_2LGFIRTWiag.png"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">How people talk on Internet</figcaption></figure><h4 name="94c1" id="94c1" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure">Problems with http</h4><p name="e195" id="e195" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Let’s say you are sitting in a lecture hall, and the professor asks you to go to a specific website. Every student in the lecture makes a request to that website and are given a response. This means that the same exact data was sent individually to each student in the room. If there are 100 students, then that’s 100 requests and 100 responses. This is obviously not the most efficient way to do things. Ideally, the students will be able to leverage their physical proximity to more efficiently retrieve the information they need.</p><p name="5993" id="5993" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">HTTP also presents a big problem if there is some problem in the networks line of communication and the client is unable to connect with the server. This can happen if an ISP has an outage, a country is blocking some content, or if the content was simply deleted or moved. These types of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener noopener" target="_blank">broken links</a> exist everywhere on the HTTP web.</p><p name="af7e" id="af7e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The location-based addressing model of HTTP encourages centralization. It’s convenient to trust a handful of applications with all our data but because of this much of the data on the web becomes soiled. This leaves those providers with enormous responsibility and power over our information(*cough facebook sucks cough*).</p><p name="6dfe" id="6dfe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">HTTP is great for loading websites but it wasn’t designed for the transfer of large amounts data (like audio and video files).

Merkle trees ensure that data blocks exchanged on p2p networks are correct, undamaged and unaltered. This verification is done by organizing data blocks using <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function" data-href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">cryptographic hash</a> functions. This is simply a function that takes an input and calculates a unique alphanumeric string (hash) corresponding with that input. It is easy to check that an input will result in a given hash, but incredibly difficult to guess the input from a hash.</p><p name="16b5" id="16b5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The individual blocks of data are called ‘leaf nodes’, which are hashed to form ‘non-leaf nodes’. These non leaf nodes can then be combined and hashed, until all the data blocks can be represent by a single root hash.

A simple example of a DAG is a family tree. A merkle DAG is basically a data structure where hashes are used to reference data blocks and objects in a DAG. This creates several useful features: all content on IPFS can be uniquely identified, since each data block has a unique hash. Plus the data is tamper-resistant because to alter it would change the hash, as shown below:</p><figure name="f782" id="f782" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 494px; max-height: 303px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 61.3%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*AiVQ5qZOV2WcrHDJ." data-width="494" data-height="303" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*AiVQ5qZOV2WcrHDJ."></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">Un-tamperable nature of Merkle tree</figcaption></figure><p name="beb4" id="beb4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The central tenet of IPFS is modeling all data on a generalized Merkle DAG.

The most popular example of this is Github, which allows developers to easily collaborate on projects simultaneously. Files on Github are stored and versioned using a merkle DAG. It allows users to independently duplicate and edit multiple versions of a file, store these versions and later merge edits with the original file.</p><p name="6002" id="6002" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">IPFS uses a similar model for data objects: as long as objects corresponding to the original data, and any new versions are accessible, the entire file history can be retrieved. Given that data blocks are stored locally across the network and can be cached indefinitely, this means that IPFS objects can be stored permanently.</p><p name="02cb" id="02cb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Additionally, IPFS does not rely on access to Internet protocols. Data can be distributed in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlay_network" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlay_network" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">overlay networks</a>, which are simply networks built on another network.

It is a distributed file system that doesn’t require special permissions for data exchange. It is “self-certifying” because data served to a client is authenticated by the file name (which is signed by the server). The result? You can securely access remote content with the transparency of local storage.</p><p name="fc0c" id="fc0c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">IPFS builds on this concept to create the InterPlanetary Name Space (IPNS).

We mentioned earlier that all objects on IPFS can be uniquely identified, but this also extends to nodes. Each node on the network has a set of public keys, private keys and a node ID which is the hash of its public key. Nodes can therefore use their private keys to ‘sign’ any data objects they publish, and the authenticity of this data can be verified using the sender’s public key.</p><p name="8022" id="8022" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Here’s a quick recap of the key IPFS components:</strong></p><ul class="postList"><li name="b70e" id="b70e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">With the Distributed Hash Table, nodes can store &amp; share data without central coordination.</li><li name="c1ed" id="c1ed" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">IPNS allows exchanged data to be instantly pre-authenticated and verified using public key cryptography.</li><li name="7bb0" id="7bb0" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">The Merkle DAG enables uniquely identified, tamper-resistant and permanently stored data.</li></ul><p name="7621" id="7621" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">You can check out more(in-depth) on how files are distributed in the network in <a href="https://medium.com/@ConsenSys/an-introduction-to-ipfs-9bba4860abd0#05c9" data-href="https://medium.com/@ConsenSys/an-introduction-to-ipfs-9bba4860abd0#05c9" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank">this article</a> by <a href="https://medium.com/u/6c7078bf7b01" data-href="https://medium.com/u/6c7078bf7b01" data-anchor-type="2" data-user-id="6c7078bf7b01" data-action-value="6c7078bf7b01" data-action="show-user-card" data-action-type="hover" class="markup--user markup--p-user" target="_blank">ConsenSys</a>.

Upon conclusion of a contract, 3.9% of both the allowance and the deposit is collected by the software and paid to holders of Siafunds, a secondary token of the protocol. Nebulous Labs, the company developing the protocol, holds ~90% of Siafunds.</p><p name="2493" id="2493" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is certainly an interesting long-term funding model and an alternative to the “all-at-once” ICO model in vogue today; however, this feature may impose a structural cost on the system that makes it more expensive than competitors. File storage is likely to be a highly competitive market, driving down prices significantly (compared to current centralized options). Once several different decentralized cloud storage platforms have been deployed, these protocols will compete not just with centralized alternatives but also with one another. Sia levies their 3.9% fee on both the allowance and the deposit, but in most contracts both of these fees are paid by the user. Other protocols do not have this structural cost, and that may make them less expensive and more attractive to users in the long-term.</p><p name="b37e" id="b37e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Prices change, but you can expect to pay in the region of 109 Siacoins or $1 per TB/month.</p><h4 name="a95f" id="a95f" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Contracts Renew Over Time</h4><p name="7cc3" id="7cc3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Renters prepay for storage within file contracts, setting aside a fixed amount of Siacoin to be spent on storing and transferring data. File contracts typically last 90 days.</p><p name="a967" id="a967" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Sia automatically renews contracts when they are within a certain window of expiring. If contracts are not renewed, Sia returns any unused coins to the renter at the end of the contract period.</p><p name="2579" id="2579" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As individual hosts go offline, Sia automatically moves renter data to new hosts in a process called file repair.</p><h4 name="bfbf" id="bfbf" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Hosts Submit Storage Proofs</h4><p name="7e78" id="7e78" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">At the end of a file contract, the host must prove that he/she is storing the renter’s data. This is called a storage proof. If the storage proof appears on the blockchain within a certain timeframe, the host is paid. If not, the host is penalized.</p><p name="4f72" id="4f72" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Storage proofs are made possible by a technology called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Merkle trees</a>. Merkle trees make it possible to prove that a small segment of data is part of a larger file. The advantage of these proofs is that they are very small, no matter how large the file is. This is important because the proofs are stored permanently on the blockchain.</p><p name="7faf" id="7faf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Finally, Sia faces a somewhat significant barrier to entry. Currently, one must purchase Bitcoin, use that to purchase Siacoins, and send the Siacoins to the Sia client software to begin using the network. For everyday users who do not already hold cryptocurrencies, this is a major roadblock. It also presents an issue for enterprise clients, since most businesses remain unwilling to hold or transact in cryptocurrencies for regulatory and financial risk reasons. To date, the Sia team has not prioritized design, accessibility, or us ability, and has given no indications that this is a significant priority.</p><p name="0298" id="0298" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">THINGS TO REMEMBER:</strong></p><ul class="postList"><li name="af78" id="af78" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Unlike Swarm and IPFS, Sia is a distributed cloud storage system.

It is one of the first decentralized, end-to-end encrypted cloud storage platform.</p><p name="74a7" id="74a7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Storj is made up of a bunch of interlocking pieces working together to create a unified system. As people interact with various parts of this system, they get a different idea of what Storj is. A home user doesn’t need any knowledge of the Bridge or of the protocol in order to share storage space, and a developer doesn’t need to know anything about the home users in order to use the Storj API. Each person can have a drastically different experience while interacting with the same system. So what is Storj? It’s a protocol, a suite of software, and the people who design, build, and use it.</p><h4 name="8fe4" id="8fe4" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">The Storj Protocol</h4><p name="3df6" id="3df6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Storj’s core technology is an enforceable, peer-to-peer, storage contract. It’s a way for two people (or computers) to agree to exchange some amount of storage for money without knowing each other. We call the computer selling space the “farmer,” and the computer purchasing space the “renter.” The renter and farmer meet, negotiate an agreement, and move data from the renter to the farmer for safekeeping.</p><h4 name="6884" id="6884" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Contracts &amp; Audits</h4><p name="4b62" id="4b62" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">A contract has a set duration. Over this time, the renter periodically checks that the farmer is still available. The farmer responds with a cryptographic proof that it still has the file. Finally, the renter pays the farmer for each proof it receives and verifies. This process of challenge -&gt; proof -&gt; payment is referred to as an “audit,” as the renter is auditing the farmer’s storage. At the end of the contract period, the farmer and renter are free to renegotiate or end the relationship.</p><p name="9321" id="9321" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While the core technology allows for any type of payment, some types are better suited than others. Traditional payment systems, like ACH or SEPA, are poorly suited to paying on a per-audit basis. They’re slow, hard to verify, and often come with expensive fees. The ideal payment method for the Storj Protocol is a cryptocurrency micropayment channel. It allows for extremely small payments that are immediately verifiable and secure, with minimal fees. This means that payments and audits can be paired as closely as possible.</p><p name="49c2" id="49c2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Enforcement follows a simple tit-for-tat model: if the farmer fails an audit, i.e. is offline or can’t demonstrate that she still has the data, then the renter doesn’t have to pay. After all, he’s no longer getting the service he was paying for. Similarly, if a renter goes offline, or fails to make a payment on time, the farmer can drop the data, and look for a new contract from someone else. As long as both parties are following the terms of the contract, everyone ends up better off.</p><p name="6843" id="6843" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Pairing the payments directly to the audits minimizes the risk of dealing with a stranger. If the file gets dropped halfway through the contract, the renter only paid for the service actually performed, as proven by the audits. He needs to find a new farmer, but is not out any significant amount of money. If a renter disappears or stops paying a farmer, the farmer has received payment for all her previous services already. She’s only missing one audit payment, and the time it takes to find a new renter to buy that space.</p><h4 name="0491" id="0491" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">The Storj Network</h4><p name="314e" id="314e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">To enable renters and farmers to meet each other, the contracting and negotiation system has been built on top of a distributed hash table (DHT). A DHT is basically a way of self-organizing a bunch of nodes into a useful network. We’re using a modified version of an algorithm called <a href="https://prestwi.ch/kademlia-and-colors/" data-href="https://prestwi.ch/kademlia-and-colors/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener noopener" target="_blank">Kademlia</a>.</p><p name="7cb4" id="7cb4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Instead of having a central server register every node and coordinate all contracts, the DHT lets farmers and renters broadcast their contract offers to a wide group of nodes. Interested nodes can easily contact the person who made the contract offer. That way farmers and renters can find any number of potential partners, and buy or sell storage space on a broad permissionless market.</p><p name="3a1d" id="3a1d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To find a partner, a node can sign an incomplete contract and publish it to the network. Other nodes on the network can subscribe to certain types of contracts (i.e. types they might be interested in) and respond to these published offers. This model is called publish-subscribe or pub/sub. Nodes can easily determine what contracts they’re interested in, and forward on contracts to other nodes they think might be interested.</p><p name="590b" id="590b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Together, the contracting system and the network form what we call the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Storj Protocol</em>. It’s a description of how nodes on the network behave, how nodes communicate with other nodes, how contracts get negotiated and executed, and everything else necessary to buy and sell storage space on a distributed system. Anyone can implement the Storj Protocol in any way they please.</p><h4 name="608a" id="608a" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Storj Toolset</h4><p name="c8e8" id="c8e8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The protocol contains all the tools necessary to securely make storage contracts, but it’s missing a lot of things. It functions, but it’s not useful yet. To be useful to a renter, the system needs availability, bandwidth, and any number of other commitments in the form of a Service Level Agreement (SLA). The farming software needs management features to avoid using excessive resources and automation features to effectively deploy to multiple hosts. Instead of trying to fit all these features into the core protocol, Storj opted to address them in an additional software layer. To make this network useful and easy to interact with, Storj is releasing two tools: <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Storj Share</em> and <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Bridge</em>.</p><h4 name="4d38" id="4d38" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">StorjShare</h4><p name="8ead" id="8ead" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">StorjShare is the reference farming client. It allows users to easily setup and run a farm on any machine. StorjShare is available as a command-line interface (CLI) for more advanced users and to enable automation. The CLI allows the user to set parameters like the amount of storage space to share, storage location, and a payment address. It also handles contract negotiation, audit responses, and all other network communications.</p><p name="f83c" id="f83c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Storj is also releasing a StorjShare graphical user interface (GUI) in order to streamline the farming process for our non-technical users. Anyone can download the StorjShare GUI, fill in a few fields, and join the network. The GUI is a wrapper around the CLI which does all the heavy lifting. After initial setup, the user rarely needs to interact with the StorjShare GUI. They should be able to set it up, minimize it, and let it run in the background.</p><p name="045c" id="045c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If the user opts in to data collection, StorjShare will also collect system telemetry. This data might include hard drive capacity and level of utilization as well as information about network connection quality. The telemetry data gets sent back to Storj Labs so that Storj developers can use it to improve the network and our software. In the future, StorjShare could even enable people to opt in to special services and programs.</p><h4 name="e382" id="e382" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Bridge</h4><p name="a941" id="a941" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">To help renters use the network, Storj also created Bridge. Bridge is designed to be deployed to a production server to handle contract negotiation, auditing, payments, availability, and a number of other needs. Bridge exposes these services and, by extension, storage resources via an Application Programming Interface (API) and client. The client is designed to be integrated into other apps, so that any application can use a Bridge server to store data on the Storj network without having to be a part of the network.</p><p name="d05a" id="d05a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As its name implies, Bridge is a centralized bridge into the decentralized Storj network. Its goal is to allow traditional applications to interact with the Storj network like they would with any other object store. It distills all the complexities of p2p communication and storage contract negotiation to push and pull requests. Unlike most object stores, Bridge doesn’t deal directly in objects, but rather in references to objects. It stores pointers to the locations of the objects on the distributed network, as well as the information necessary to audit those objects. Ideally, no data will transit through Bridge, but rather will be transmitted directly to farmers on the network.</p><p name="0994" id="0994" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Bridge Client handles all the client-side work to use the network effectively. It encrypts files as they enter the network, preserving privacy and security. To ensure availability, it shards files, applies erasure coding, and spreads the shards across multiple farmers. The client then communicates with the Bridge to manage each of the shard locations on the network, and helps the user manage their encryption keys locally. While the initial implementation of the Bridge Client is a Node.js package, the end goal is to have it available in many other languages.</p><h4 name="51f8" id="51f8" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">The Storj API</h4><p name="b881" id="b881" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Storj core service is an object store, similar to Amazon S3. This object store is managed by a set of public Bridge nodes. We maintain the infrastructure to negotiate contracts, manage payments, audits, etc. Our customers interact with our Bridges via the Bridge Client, and never even have to know they’re using a distributed network. The API is designed for usability, so everything complicated gets handled behind the scenes to provide a smooth, extensible development experience.</p><p name="1472" id="1472" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Storj uses its extensive knowledge of the network to provide the top-notch quality of service. The decisions their Bridge makes are based on historical interactions with countless farmers. Storj uses data about their performance, as well as their self-reported telemetry data, to intelligently distribute data across the network. Storj optimizes for high uptime as well as fast retrieval.</p><p name="a766" id="a766" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Account management features are available via the Bridge Client, or via Storj’s beautiful webapp. Again, the function of the GUI is to make the experience as smooth as possible. Storj believes that user experience (UX) is tragically neglected by most developer-oriented services, and because of this, they’re designing the product with simplicity and usability in mind. Instead of offering a wide range of cloud computing and storage services, they aim to offer a single elegant user experience.</p><p name="b9cb" id="b9cb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">With the Storj API, they’re trying to build the ideal tool for developers like us: people who care about time-to-prototype, high-quality code, and rapid iteration. They want to provide tools and support to small teams, rapidly-scaling products, and individual developers. They understand that every developer actually works for himself/herself, and the projects he/she cares about. This is a labor of love for us. Storj wants to build an object store that gets out of the way so that developers can concentrate on building the projects they love.</p><p name="c139" id="c139" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You can learn more about Storj from <a href="https://medium.com/u/31bb19d6e641" data-href="https://medium.com/u/31bb19d6e641" data-anchor-type="2" data-user-id="31bb19d6e641" data-action-value="31bb19d6e641" data-action="show-user-card" data-action-type="hover" class="markup--user markup--p-user" target="_blank">Storj Labs</a>.</p><p name="8efb" id="8efb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/storj/" data-href="https://www.reddit.com/r/storj/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Storj Reddit</strong></a><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"> | </strong><a href="https://twitter.com/storjproject" data-href="https://twitter.com/storjproject" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Storj Twitter</strong></a><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"> | </strong><a href="https://github.com/storj" data-href="https://github.com/storj" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Storj Github</strong></a></p><h3 name="92ae" id="92ae" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">5.

It provides Secure Access For Everyone (SAFE). Data stored on the network has extremely high availability, durability, privacy and security. The network scales efficiently and the security of data stored on the network increases as the network grows.</p><h4 name="0821" id="0821" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Why SAFE Network?</h4><p name="452e" id="452e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The existing server-client-based internet gives ownership of data to whoever operates the servers, rather than the people creating the data. The operators can restrict, modify, remove or sell that data with no recourse from the user that created it. Poor acceptance and availability of federated protocols to distribute user data on terms that favour the creators has motivated the creation of the SAFE Network.</p><p name="61db" id="61db" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Clients storing data on the SAFE Network are protected by default with strong encryption and can control access through a flexible permissions layer.</p><p name="a594" id="a594" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Clients retrieving data from the SAFE Network are protected by a secure routing and addressing system.</p><p name="7ca8" id="7ca8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Clients benefit from secure defaults, including built-in end-to-end encryption and secure authentication.</p><p name="8a9a" id="8a9a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The network is comprised of a graph of independently operated nodes (called vaults) that validate, store and deliver data. Vault operators can contribute to the retention of network data and network performance by supplying disc space and bandwidth for use by the network. Vault operators may join or leave the network at any time without affecting the security of data stored on the network.</p><p name="46a0" id="46a0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Network tokens called Safecoin are distributed to vault operators by the network for providing these resources. The tokens may then be used to purchase network storage space for their own use or to utilise other resources on the network. This motivates benevolent behaviour of vault operators and protects the network against malicious behaviour.</p><p name="8120" id="8120" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The network utilises SHA3–256 identifiers for vaults and data in combination with XOR distances between these identifiers to anonymise and globally distribute all data and traffic.</p><p name="f9f0" id="f9f0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Much of the existing internet infrastructure is improved by the SAFE Network, including Addressing, Domain Name System, Transport Layer Security, Packet Routing, server software such as http web servers and imap mail servers, authentication layers such as oauth and openid; these are all superseded by secure-by-default modules that combine to make the SAFE Network operable.</p><p name="9e8c" id="9e8c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">SAFE operates on existing physical internet infrastructure, but replaces all layers of the network from there up. It primarily targets OSI layers 3 to 7.</p><figure name="c7a6" id="c7a6" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 449px; max-height: 349px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 77.7%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*yZUACzrdOWirdY5tGsB4OA.png" data-width="449" data-height="349" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*yZUACzrdOWirdY5tGsB4OA.png"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">The OSI Model</figcaption></figure><h3 name="928e" id="928e" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure">Client Operations</h3><p name="518c" id="518c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Clients can upload and download data from the SAFE Network. This section outlines how these operations are conducted.</p><h4 name="4155" id="4155" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Resource Identifiers</h4><p name="935a" id="935a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Clients that wish to download data from the SAFE Network require software that can translate SAFE resource identifiers to endpoints on the SAFE Network, much like how browsers translate http URLs to endpoints on a server. Downloading data requires no special permissions or access, just software that can locate and interpret the data on the network.</p><p name="d238" id="d238" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Resources are stored on the network as content addressable resources. The identifier for these resources are SHA3–256 hashes of the resource content. This 256 bit identifier is used to retrieve a resource from the network (thus acting similarly to an IP address), allowing the client to specify which part of the network may be able to serve their request.</p><p name="041f" id="041f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The 256 bit resource identifier may be represented in a human-friendly form using the built-in SAFE DNS, such as <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">safe://www.userX/video.mp4</code>. This can be converted to the 256 bit identifier for the file by a lookup on the SAFE Network using software that can interpret SAFE DNS records.</p><h3 name="3447" id="3447" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Self Encryption</h3><p name="47be" id="47be" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Resources on the SAFE Network are never more than 1 MB each. Clients working with files larger than 1 MB will have their data automatically split into 1 MB chunks that are then distributed across the network.</p><p name="7c71" id="7c71" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This means a typical file on the network consists of several parts: <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">chunks</em> which are individual 1 MB portions after the file is split, and a <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">datamap</em> which stores the identifier of each portion of the file. The network sees the datamap as just another chunk.</p><p name="2d15" id="2d15" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The client keeps a record of the resource identifier for the datamap. Thus, by initially retrieving that single resource (ie the datamap) the entire file can be retrieved despite being spread over many individual resources. This allows any resource to be addressed by a single resource identifier.</p><p name="29e0" id="29e0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The datamap also acts as an encryption key for the chunks it refers to. Chunks are encrypted by that key, so vaults cannot read individual chunks to gain an insight to part of the original. This is known as Self Encryption.</p><p name="3f85" id="3f85" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Additionally, the file may be encrypted by the client before being uploaded using the encryption option built-in to the client software. This is uses a unique secure key derived from the authentication the user has with the network. This means the key to decrypt the file never leaves the client and is never exposed to the network, allowing extremely secure storage of data which cannot be decrypted by any vault on the network, even with access to the datamap.</p><p name="d5f2" id="d5f2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Splitting the file via self encryption has many benefits.</p><ul class="postList"><li name="2e2d" id="2e2d" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">chunks on their own are not useful, so all chunks are fungible and of equal value to the network</li><li name="9c00" id="9c00" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">chunks for a file can be downloaded in parallel by clients, increasing performance</li><li name="8b14" id="8b14" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">chunks have unique and widely distributed names, so cannot easily be correlated with each other</li><li name="38de" id="38de" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">wide distribution of chunks greatly reduces the chance of data loss when individual vaults go offline</li><li name="1c81" id="1c81" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">blacklisting based on content is not possible</li></ul><h3 name="b0d3" id="b0d3" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--li">Immutable Data</h3><p name="ca7e" id="ca7e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Resource identifiers are determined by the content of that resource. This means two identical copies of a resource will have the same identifier (eg the same photo kept on my phone and my laptop). This comes with several benefits:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="b10e" id="b10e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">resource identifiers are universal, unique and permanent (unlike urls on the current internet)</li><li name="c4b1" id="c4b1" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">resources cannot be duplicated on the network, increasing storage efficiency</li><li name="701f" id="701f" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">caching rules for resources are extremely simple and efficient</li><li name="dd7e" id="dd7e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">encrypted resources are unique to the key that encrypts them, so cannot be decrypted by the vaults that store them</li></ul><h3 name="4265" id="4265" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--li">Network Traversal</h3><p name="97ba" id="97ba" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">When a client connects to the network they are allocated a session identifier. The session identifier determines which vault acts as their entry point to the network.</p><p name="6142" id="6142" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When the client requests a resource, the request is sent to their entry point vault, which is then routed via several other vaults on the network before finally reaching the vault storing the data being requested. The data is then passed back along the route to the client.</p><p name="bd94" id="bd94" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This routing mechanism traverses a 256 bit namespace progressively via closest XOR distance.</p><p name="7dc7" id="7dc7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The resource being requested has a unique 256 bit identifier determined by the self encryption process. The vault acting as the entry point for the client also has a unique 256 bit identifier (as do all vaults).</p><p name="9382" id="9382" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The chunk identifier is XORed with the entry point vault identifier. The resulting value is the XOR distance between the chunk and the vault.</p><p name="99bd" id="99bd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If a neighbouring vault has an identifier with a smaller XOR distance to the chunk, the request is passed to that vault.</p><p name="e77a" id="e77a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This continues until there is no vault with a closer XOR distance to the chunk.</p><p name="b749" id="b749" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The chunk will be stored in the vault with the identifier closest to the chunk identifier (measured using XOR distance).</p><p name="2eaf" id="2eaf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That vault checks if it has a copy of the requested chunk and returns the response back along the route the request came from.</p><p name="e3a7" id="e3a7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This process forms a request chain where each vault only knows the details of the node one step away in the chain. The original requester and the vault storing the chunk are separated by this chain of vaults, making the request anonymous.</p><p name="b4b5" id="b4b5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The same network traversal happens when storing chunks. Chunks enter the network via their entry point vault, and are then passed on until they reach the closest vault, which then stores the chunk.</p><p name="5939" id="5939" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Nodes along the route can cache the chunk so if another request for it is made later, perhaps by a different route, it can be responded to sooner without having to extend the request all the way to the final storage vault.</p><h3 name="2a6e" id="2a6e" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Messaging</h3><p name="d501" id="d501" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Email and instant messaging are ubiquitous experiences of the current internet. The SAFE Network facilitates messaging which can replace imap / smtp / xmpp servers.</p><p name="7f6e" id="7f6e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A message may be stored on the network the same way any resource may be stored. To ensure the message remains private, the message may be encrypted prior to sending using the recipients key (that key can also be stored as a resource on the SAFE Network). By the same method, connections between contacts (like the gpg web of trust) may also be represented on the network by resources. This collection of resources form the foundation for a secure messaging platform.</p><p name="4f04" id="4f04" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The only remaining step is to notify the recipient when they have received a message.</p><p name="6c6a" id="6c6a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On the current internet, new messages are typically presented to the user by adding a message to their inbox. Since an inbox is simply a list of messages, this list may be represented as a resource on the network. However, in the case of the SAFE Network, the inbox is created not as immutable data, but as mutable data. This second data type has a fixed identifier which does not depend on the content of the resource. This, combined with a permissions system, allows data at that identifier to be updated.</p><p name="8bb0" id="8bb0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This data type allows the recipient to be notified of their new message by updating the data located at the identifier for the recipients inbox. The inbox resource can be created with permission for anyone to append new data. The sender of the message appends the identifier of their message to the inbox of the recipient, and the recipient is able to locate the new message.</p><p name="960d" id="960d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This messaging system facilitates features such as email and instant messaging, but also introduces scope for other systems based on messaging such as payments, smart contracts, social networking, inter-process signalling, dynamic web content, stun servers for webrtc…</p><h3 name="5917" id="5917" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Mutable Data</h3><p name="8bc0" id="8bc0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Mutable data is the second and final data type present on the network. It allows data at a fixed location on the network to be modified.</p><p name="bb7d" id="bb7d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A strong permissions layer allows the owner of the mutable data to specify who may change it and how they may change it.</p><p name="f7dc" id="f7dc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The validation of ownership and modification of mutable data is performed by the network using digital signatures. The owner of mutable data can specify which keys are permitted or denied modifications to the data.</p><p name="ef78" id="ef78" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Each key is permitted or denied specific actions to the existing content. These actions are either ‘update’ or ‘append’.</p><p name="6e1f" id="6e1f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">By combining clearly defined permissions with cryptographically secure signatures, the modifications to mutable data may be strictly controlled by the owner.</p><p name="2349" id="2349" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The content of mutable data may point to other mutable data, allowing the creation of chains of mutable data that can be used for many purposes such as version control and branching, verifiable history and data recovery.</p><h3 name="194f" id="194f" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Network Operations</h3><p name="9404" id="9404" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">There are several operations performed by the network that allow clients to store and retrieve data securely and reliably. These operations give rise to an autonomous self-healing network which is resistant to attack.</p><h3 name="3b77" id="3b77" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Close Group Consensus</h3><p name="e26e" id="e26e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Nodes on the network (known as vaults) are primarily responsible for storing chunks of data. The availability of chunks is critical to the success of the network.</p><p name="1aa3" id="1aa3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Since anyone may add or remove their vaults from the network at any time, the network must be able to detect and respond to malicious behaviour before it results in the loss of data. This requires enforcement of a set of rules governing acceptable behaviour of vaults. Vaults which don’t comply with the rules are rejected from the network and are not responsible for client data.</p><p name="57f0" id="57f0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The enforcement of the rules occurs through a process called Close Group Consensus.</p><p name="0de8" id="0de8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Vaults form groups which coordinate with each other to reach consensus about the state of the data on the network. Any vault which does not comply with the consensus of the group is rejected and replaced by a different vault.</p><p name="9df3" id="9df3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The rules that groups enforce are that data:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="c6ab" id="c6ab" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">can be stored</li><li name="4499" id="4499" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">can be retrieved</li><li name="b0a0" id="b0a0" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">has not been modified</li></ul><p name="7ef2" id="7ef2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">This depends on vaults in the group having:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="7055" id="7055" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">space available to store new data</li><li name="6912" id="6912" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">bandwidth available to relay that data when it’s requested</li><li name="5c8e" id="5c8e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">sufficient participation in achieving consensus with the rest of the group</li></ul><h3 name="cc63" id="cc63" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--li">Vault Naming</h3><p name="4a1c" id="4a1c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">All vaults are allocated a random unique 256 bit identifier by the network upon joining or rejoining. Vaults that are close together (measured by the XOR distance between their identifiers) form groups. The vaults in a group work together to form consensus about data on the network so it may be stored and retrieved. Groups are formed in sets of between 8 and 22 close vaults. The more vaults on the network, the greater the number groups on the network.</p><p name="8aec" id="8aec" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If a majority of vaults in a group are dishonest, the data in that group is vulnerable to corruption.</p><p name="4f79" id="4f79" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This means the group size is a trade off between being large enough that it’s difficult to gain control of a majority of vaults in the group and being small enough that consensus can be reached quickly.</p><p name="a611" id="a611" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The security of the network primarily arises because the attacker <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">may not choose the identifier for their vault</em>. They must join and leave repeatedly until the network allocates their vault an identifier in the group they are attempting to control. They must do this for a majority of vaults in a group in order to control consensus for that group.</p><p name="3fbf" id="3fbf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The difficulty of controlling a group is thus determined by the size of the network, becoming proportionally harder as the network grows in size. The larger the network the more groups there are; the more groups there are the harder it is to join any one specific group.</p><p name="2372" id="2372" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Overcoming the network-allocated-identifier for new vaults is the primary source of difficulty in trying to abuse the consensus mechanism.</p><h3 name="b96a" id="b96a" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Disjoint Sections</h3><p name="65d7" id="65d7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">A practical consideration of the formation of groups is the efficiency of inter-group messaging (ie consensus of group membership rather than consensus of individual vault behaviour).</p><p name="1cba" id="1cba" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Groups are formed based on the similarity of the leading bits of their identifier (this portion of the identifier is called the Prefix for the Section).</p><p name="4e9a" id="4e9a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This makes the coordination of vaults leaving or joining the group much simpler.</p><p name="f07e" id="f07e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If groups were to retain a constant membership of 8 vaults, there’s a need to reorganizing individual vaults between groups as new vaults join and leave. This may have a cascading effect on nearby groups.</p><p name="1271" id="1271" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Rather than do this cascading reorganization, groups may vary in size between 8 and 22 vaults. If a group becomes larger than 22 vaults it’s split into two new groups, and if it becomes less than 8 vaults it’s merged back into the nearest group.</p><p name="86b4" id="86b4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This method of organizing groups is called Disjoint Sections.</p><h3 name="988d" id="988d" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Churn</h3><p name="03ce" id="03ce" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Vaults are established in random locations on the network to prevent attacks on the group consensus mechanism. This security is further strengthened by intermittent relocation of vaults. An attack on the group must happen before relocation happens.</p><p name="9a95" id="9a95" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A vault is relocated by the network by allocating it a new random identifier. This causes it to leave it’s existing group and become part of a new group. Any chunks it was previously storing become the responsibility of a different vault and is automatically handled by the group consensus mechanism. The relocated vault must now store chunks that are closest to it’s new identifier and continue building consensus with a new group of vaults.</p><p name="db68" id="db68" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This mechanism is known as churn and is an extension of the same process that happens when new vaults join the network or existing vaults leave.</p><h3 name="a7c3" id="a7c3" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Farming</h3><p name="7f0c" id="7f0c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The incentive for vault operators to join the network and cooperate toward the goal of secure data storage is motivated by a network token. This token (called safecoin ) can be redeemed for resources on the network or used to engage with other resources offered on the network. The motivation for the token is similar to that of blockchains — to ensure cooperation participation is a more rational course of action than uncooperative participation.</p><p name="68f5" id="68f5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Tokens are represented as mutable data on the network. The network defines a total of 2³² mutable data resources as safecoin objects, which initially have no owner so do not exist as far as the token economy is concerned.</p><p name="13d7" id="13d7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The network intermittently allocates unowned safecoins to network participants via a Proof Of Resource mechanism, which causes the total number of tokens to grow over time, acting as a bootstrapping mechanism for the token and network storage economy.</p><p name="de74" id="de74" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The total number of safecoins allocated may also shrink when safecoins are exchanged for network resources. Users must exchange safecoin to store data on the network. This involves submitting safecoin to the network which will then clear the safecoin owner and allocate network storage space for that user to consume. This mechanism is known as coin recycling and provides a counterbalance to the growth of safecoin allocated through Proof Of Resource.</p><p name="88c3" id="88c3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Safecoin is transferred between users by digitally signing a transfer of ownership for the safecoin mutable data resource to the recipients key. The digital signature is easily verified using the key of the existing owner stored in the mutable data resource. Once the owner is updated the transfer is complete, making safecoin transfers extremely fast, efficient and secure.</p><h3 name="47ff" id="47ff" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Proof Of Resource</h3><p name="c959" id="c959" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">When cooperative behaviour from vaults is observed by the network, the vault earns the right to claim ownership of a safecoin. The specific safecoin identifier for each claim is randomly generated by the network.</p><p name="6b0d" id="6b0d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If the safecoin for that identifier is not currently owned, the network assigns it to the owner of the vault, thus minting a new safecoin into the economy.</p><p name="5b4b" id="5b4b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If the safecoin for that identifier is already owned no further action is taken.</p><p name="520b" id="520b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In this sense, much like blockchain proof of work, safecoin farming has an element of chance that should lead to an even distribution proportional to the resources supplied.</p><p name="95b3" id="95b3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The rate at which safecoin is allocated is adjusted in a similar way to the blockchain difficulty mechanism. The adjustment aims to balance the availability of resources on the network. It encourages the provision of more resources when needed and discourages wasteful excess by reducing reward during times of oversupply.</p><p name="bfae" id="bfae" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The safecoin disbursement algorithm has not yet been formally specified or implemented.</p><p name="5053" id="5053" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The network defines cooperative behaviour as the reliable supply of bandwidth and storage space, and continued involvement in reaching consensus. Unlike blockchain Proof Of Work, where end users receive diminishing returns from further growth in mining capacity, the Proof Of Resource mechanism continues to provide utility to end users proportional to the growth of network resources.</p><h3 name="7416" id="7416" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Conclusion</h3><p name="9b3f" id="9b3f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The SAFE Network is an autonomous network for reliable data storage and communications. The combination of a robust data storage and messaging system forms a secure and private alternative to much of the existing infrastructure of the internet.</p><p name="0ae9" id="0ae9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Data is stored efficiently and reliably on the network using content addressable resource identifiers and self encryption.</p><p name="30c0" id="30c0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Data is retained without corruption and may be retrieved at any time through the use of close group consensus and disjoint sections.</p><p name="07e2" id="07e2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A network allocated token to incentivise the supply of resources within the agreed rules of the system discourages malicious behaviour and ensures the sustainable supply of resources for future clients. The distribution is based on a Proof Of Resource mechanism which is difficult to cheat and exhibits positive externality.</p><p name="c568" id="c568" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The network improves in speed, security and reliability as more vaults are added, making rapid increases in scale a benefit rather than a concern.</p><p name="cbc6" id="cbc6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">End users benefit from secure-by-default modules and a flexible permissions layer to control access in the manner best suit their needs. The SAFE Network combines many individual modules to create a network with Secure Access For Everyone.</p><p name="1e6d" id="1e6d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/maidsafe/" data-href="https://www.reddit.com/r/maidsafe/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">MaidSafe Reddit</strong></a><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"> | </strong><a href="https://twitter.com/maidsafe" data-href="https://twitter.com/maidsafe" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">MaidSafe Twitter</strong></a><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"> | </strong><a href="https://github.com/maidsafe" data-href="https://github.com/maidsafe" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">MaidSafe Github</strong></a></p></div></div></section><section name="07b7" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="89a2" id="89a2" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">That’s all.
