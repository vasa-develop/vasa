But first, let me make the case that this shift is going to happen faster than we expected. First, let’s talk about electric cars. May I present to you the 1914 electric model 47, an all-electric car available in 1914.</p><figure name="e7cd" id="e7cd" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 467px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 66.7%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*CCGU4RAe1B1o5O4_.jpg" data-width="700" data-height="467" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*CCGU4RAe1B1o5O4_.jpg"></div></figure><p name="7d8b" id="7d8b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">People loved this car. It was quiet, it had a range of 80 miles, it didn’t need to be hand cranked to start, and it was reliable. So, you didn’t need a fleet of mechanics on standby to make sure that your car wouldn’t break down. A lot of celebrities of the day drove this car, Thomas Edison, Mamie Eisenhower john d Rockefeller Jr., and very famously Clara Ford the wife of Henry Ford. In fact, a lot of people don’t know that <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">in 1900, nearly a third (28%) of all cars produced were actually electric.</em></strong> But today, the overwhelming majority of the cars that we drive are gas-powered. If you look at this chart(below), the electric cars are shown in blue. I’m being generous here, I’m including all the hybrids, all the plug-in hybrids as well as all the all-electric cars like the Tesla.</p><figure name="c3ba" id="c3ba" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 321px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 45.9%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*tdnQJdlJXdpSpL3u1b-8Hg.png" data-width="1122" data-height="515" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*tdnQJdlJXdpSpL3u1b-8Hg.png"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">Source: PHEV Sales, <a href="https://www.bts.gov/" data-href="https://www.bts.gov/" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bureau of Transportation Statistics</a></figcaption></figure><p name="0dc3" id="0dc3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">You can barely see them(electric cars) on this graph of total car sales now. There are a few outliers, Norway is almost 50% now, the Netherlands is 6% electric, California’s 5% electric. But overall, under 3% of today’s sales of cars are electric. So it’s about 500,000 out of 18 million cars sold in the U.S.</p><p name="17e3" id="17e3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Why is this? If electric cars were available at the turn of the century and they had all these benefits, they were quiet, they had a good range, they were reliable. Why don’t we drive electric cars today?</p><p name="693e" id="693e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Well, the simple answer is economics. In 1914, the Model T cost $440. It was anywhere between 2 and 6 times cheaper than the Detroit electric, that I showed you above. Not only was it dramatically cheaper, but it could also go faster, 45 miles per hour versus 20. It could also go farther, 200 miles versus 80.</p><p name="5ef7" id="5ef7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Despite the overwhelming dominance of internal combustion engine cars, The Economist last August wrote an article that was essentially an obituary for the internal combustion engine.

I believe that had we not been in the middle of this shift to electric cars, in other words, if Dyson had to make an internal combustion engine car, it never would have greenlit this project. Now the incumbents aren’t just going to give up and roll over. They are also making huge investments in this direction.

Along with the outright bans, there’s going to be targets for electric vehicle sales, that each country sets, that will dramatically encourage existing companies that are selling gas-burning cars to invest heavily in electric cars.</p><p name="b165" id="b165" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We’re going to have jurisdictions introduce rules of their own. Everybody’s waiting for the big dogs, so to speak, to write down their rules around when it will forbid the sale of gas burning cars and I’m talking about countries like Germany, China, California and then the United States overall. So there’s going to be a combination of carrots and sticks encouraging us to get into electric cars.</p><figure name="3711" id="3711" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 403px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 57.599999999999994%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*qOO3MfLi8n5zJxz8opIZsQ.png" data-width="884" data-height="509" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*qOO3MfLi8n5zJxz8opIZsQ.png"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">Source: Bloomberg</figcaption></figure><p name="8af9" id="8af9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">So you take all of those ingredients and Bloomberg is forecasting 2038, as the year where electric cars reach parity in terms of sales with gas burning cars and then they never look back.

Let’s talk about the other component of it, which is the self-driving component. All the car manufacturers and a set of startups in Silicon Valley and around the world are working hard on this technology. Apparently, if you are going to innovate in the car you always start in the trunk.</p><figure name="8434" id="8434" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 283px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 40.400000000000006%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*5kmBNXeaKGBRsacNbvPcXw.png" data-width="1240" data-height="501" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*5kmBNXeaKGBRsacNbvPcXw.png"></div></figure><p name="e6aa" id="e6aa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">There are a set of cars that you can already buy, that have partial self-driving car capabilities, in the way I like to think about it is these cars will mostly drive themselves on the freeway. They’ll keep a safe distance between you and the car in front of you. They’ll keep in the lane even if the lane curves, and you’re responsible for driving the car after it gets off the freeway. But these are cars that you can buy today, and I’m not talking about luxury cars only. You can buy cars in the $20,000 price range with a $2,000 option, with a lot of these capabilities. So something like the Honda Civic with the Honda sensing suite.</p><figure name="b76e" id="b76e" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 219px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 31.4%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*OI2jQa8I46P2HfM7xRSC8g.png" data-width="724" data-height="227" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*OI2jQa8I46P2HfM7xRSC8g.png"></div></figure><p name="79a5" id="79a5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Also, around the world, we have progressive mayors and city leaders that are leaning into this revolution and are encouraging car manufacturers to run their trials in their city.</p><figure name="8339" id="8339" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 340px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 48.6%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*urHXbDLWuuMkSO8a3IaUwQ.png" data-width="833" data-height="405" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*urHXbDLWuuMkSO8a3IaUwQ.png"></div></figure><p name="8696" id="8696" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Altogether there are 40 cities around the world actively piloting today and there’s another 20 waiting to start their electric car trials. With all this activity you’d expect both, a lot of startup activity and a lot of activity in the existing manufacturers and that’s exactly what you see. You see an all-out amazing race between the incumbents, both manufacturers, and companies in the supply chain. You see an amazing number of startups primarily located in Silicon Valley and China, that are trying to take advantage of this opportunity and building self-driving technology, that can go into any car.</p><p name="2ba4" id="2ba4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So you put these two ingredients together, the transition to electric cars and the transition to self-driving. And actually, the combination of these technologies is perfect for fleet operations. So instead of buying and operating our own cars, these things will be perfect for fleets to operate. One of the big reasons is the utilization of our own cars. Our cars are utilized maybe 5% of the day today. So, if you have a typical community, we might be driving 20 or 30 minutes. That means your cars are used for an hour out of the 24 hours of the day and it’s not driving anybody else around during that time. So from a fleet operators point of view, they can do much better than 5% utilization and the economics will dictate that most of our electric self-driving cars will end up in fleets because it’s going to be much more economically efficient for the fleet to get the most out of that car, compared to you and me driving them around.</p><p name="d5d1" id="d5d1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So if you boil it down to what’s the cost to own and operate a car today, it’s much more expensive to be driven everywhere. So if you decided that you couldn’t commit to a lift anywhere to diet it would cost you a lot more to do that today than it would be to drive your own car so that’s the left side of these bar graphs.</p><figure name="0429" id="0429" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 303px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 43.2%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*glqW-hM-1nezis5i4cXXKQ.png" data-width="1235" data-height="534" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*glqW-hM-1nezis5i4cXXKQ.png"></div></figure><p name="ccac" id="ccac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">RethinkX, a nonprofit is predicting that the cost curves will completely reverse themselves in other words by 2030 which is not that far away it will be a lot cheaper to basically lift anywhere compared to owning and operating your own car. I think that a lot of people will start shifting when the prices are close. I think a lot of people would prefer to be driven around, and if it’s even cheaper to be driven around than to drive your own car, I think this is going to be a mass-market phenomenon.</p><p name="64b3" id="64b3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So the technology trends suggest that we’ll have self-driving electric cars. But, will the people be ready? Will, we culturally be ready for the world in which we’re driven around rather than driving ourselves around. It’s a big shift. Well, as with most things these revolutions will probably begin with the younger generations.</p><figure name="63c4" id="63c4" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 364px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 52%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*SpXW1Of--4WfRbniGr3zyQ.png" data-width="959" data-height="499" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*SpXW1Of--4WfRbniGr3zyQ.png"></div></figure><p name="3455" id="3455" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">This is an answer to a survey question that Morgan Stanley and BCG ran(in 2016) and the question they asked essentially was, “how many times are you already Lyft and Uber“ing” around?” and as you can see the 18-24-year-olds are doing it monthly or several times a month, and 13% of them are doing it every day. This number drops off for the elderly. But the young people look amazingly ready for this revolution.</p><p name="27f4" id="27f4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Also, a lot of people who have been left out of the labor market, left out of the freedom of mobility, that driving your own car represents. There are older people, people with disabilities, people with blindness, people who don’t have the hand-eye coordination to pass their driver’s license exams anymore. So there’s a whole set of people that can get back into society. They can take jobs, they can visit with friends, they can go shopping.</p><p name="dbe5" id="dbe5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So the net of it is, this revolution will come on the backs of the young people who are absolutely ready, culturally, to make this transition and it’s going to re-enfranchise. It’s going to bring a lot of people who have been left out of the benefits of driving around right back into society, the older, the less capable the people who can’t drive themselves around. So, for both ends of the demographic, self-driving an electric car fleets will be awesome.</p><p name="f58e" id="f58e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">So let’s assume for a second that I’m right and we’ll put aside the question of when, until the very end of the series. We’ll pick that up at the end of the series. In the coming parts, we’ll explore how the world changes in six different areas, the area of public infrastructure, energy, finance, the justice system, and shopping. We will discuss on how does our everyday life change when we live in this world where we’re driven around in electric cars rather than driving our own gas-powered cars.</p></div></div></section><section name="7b76" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="1e92" id="1e92" class="graf graf--p graf--leading"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Special thanks to </em><a href="https://a16z.com/author/frank-chen/" data-href="https://a16z.com/author/frank-chen/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Frank Chen</em></a><em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> from Andreessen Horowitz for this </em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of5j-Lztqrg" data-href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of5j-Lztqrg" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">talk</em></a><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">, from which this article derives a lot of inspiration.</em></p><p name="4a46" id="4a46" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Thanks for reading;)</p><h4 name="dc58" id="dc58" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Learned something?
